1. The program will receive a bench file provided by the user and produce the full
   fault list on screen and the total number, as well as writing all the faults into a text file.
3. Print out the number of input bits and the number of output bits.
4. Print out the expected output of all-zero and all-one input vectors.
5. Will ask the user for a fault and simulate the effects on each internal node
   using all-zero and all-one input vectors and will conclude if each vector can detect the fault.
6. Will ask the user for input vector and a fault and simulate the effects, similarly to part 5.
7. Will ask the user for an input vector and apply fault simulation on the full fault list. Output the
   result whether each fault is detected or not, and the percentage of faults covered by this input vector.
