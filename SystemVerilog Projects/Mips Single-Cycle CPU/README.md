Developed a Mips Single-Cycle CPU in SystemVerilog. This model of the single-cycle MIPS processor divides the machine into two major units: the control unit and the datapath.
The control unit is composed of two submodues: main decoder and alu decoder. The main decoder produces all control signals except those for the ALU. The alu decoder produces the control singnals for the arithmetic loigc unit.
The datapath will consits of the program counter logic, register file logic, and alu logic.
