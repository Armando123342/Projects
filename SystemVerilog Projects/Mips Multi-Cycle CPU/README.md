Build a Mips Multi-Cycle processor that can handle the following instructions: {add, sub, and, or,
slt, lw, sw, beq, addi, j, ble, sltu}. The two major components are the control unit and the datapath.
The control unit was developed using a finite state machine. The datapath was build from sub modules for pc logic, register logic, and alu logic.
